# ArsX One-View — Progress Report

## Stage 1: Project Initialization *(01/12/2025 00:19)*
- Created WPF (.NET 9) project structure.
- Set up main files: `MainWindow.xaml`, `MainWindow.xaml.cs`, `App.xaml`, and project file.
- Added Microsoft.Web.WebView2 package for Chromium-based browser engine.

## Stage 2: Core UI and Browser Wiring *(01/12/2025 00:25)*
- Designed main window layout:
  - Discord-style left sidebar for quick site access.
  - Top toolbar with Back, Forward, Reload buttons, and URL bar.
  - Main content area hosting WebView2 browser control.
- Implemented navigation logic:
  - Toolbar buttons for browser navigation.
  - Address bar navigation.
  - Sidebar buttons for favorite sites.
  - Window title and address bar update after navigation.

## Stage 3: JSON Sidebar & ArsX Vault Foundation *(01/12/2025 01:04)*

## Stage 4: Secure ArsX Vault with DPAPI *(01/12/2025 01:16)*
- Designed a credential vault service layer for secure password storage.
- Added `Services/ICredentialStore.cs` interface for vault abstraction.
- Implemented `Services/DpapiCredentialStore.cs` using Windows DPAPI (`ProtectedData`).
- Vault stores encrypted credentials in `%APPDATA%\ArsX\OneView\vault.bin` (never in plaintext or JSON).
- Vault supports storing, retrieving, and removing passwords for site/user pairs.
- No UI for password management yet; service layer is ready for future integration.

## Stage 5: Sidebar Logo Button & Resource Management *(01/12/2025 02:45)*
- Added an `assets` folder for project images.
- Integrated the ArsX logo as a button at the top of the sidebar, linking to the ArsX website.
- Ensured image resource is copied to output and referenced correctly in XAML.
- Removed the AX title placeholder from the sidebar for a cleaner look.
- Fixed sidebar population to use a dedicated panel for dynamic site buttons.
- Resolved build/run issues related to resource linkage and XAML control access.

## Stage 6: Settings Button, About Popup & Password Manager Stub *(01/12/2025 03:27)*
- Added a Chrome-style settings button (three dots) to the toolbar next to navigation buttons.
- Implemented dropdown menu with two options: About and Password Manager.
- About option opens a custom popup window with program info and an OK button.
- Password Manager option is stubbed; user page not yet implemented.
- Resized About window for better readability.
- All previous features remain functional; minor warnings present but no critical errors.

# Progress Report (01/12/2025 03:39)

- Password Manager UI and logic completed: Add, Edit, Delete, and credential storage all work as intended.
- Domain field removed from UI and code; only Site and Username are shown and used.
- Password field now displays plain text for easier entry and review.
- All major runtime and build errors resolved; only minor warnings remain.
- Program tested and running successfully.

# completed - (01/12/2025 05:52)

## Build & Functionality
- Project builds and runs successfully with logo and sidebar buttons visible.
- All navigation and sidebar features confirmed operational.
- Remaining warnings are non-blocking (nullable properties, color conversion).

**Next Steps:**
- Add password management (with DPAPI) in future stages.
- Enhance vault features and session restore.
- Address build warnings for improved code quality.

# Stage 7: Deployment & Installer Creation *(01/12/2025 07:00)*

- Created a Windows Application Packaging Project (MSIX) for modern deployment and auto-update support.
- Integrated the binoculars icon and ensured all branding is consistent in the installer and app window.
- Chose to move MSIX creation into Visual Studio because:
  - Visual Studio provides built-in support for MSIX packaging, signing, and manifest editing.
  - The MSIX Packaging Tool is not available in all regions via the Microsoft Store.
  - Visual Studio’s workflow is more reliable for WPF and .NET desktop apps, with fewer compatibility issues than command-line or third-party tools.
- The installer can now be built, signed, and distributed directly from Visual Studio, streamlining future updates and releases.
