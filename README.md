# SolExplorer
a minimal, code-first 2D isometric “engine” inside a .NET MAUI Windows app. Use MAUI protocols: GraphicsView + IDrawable for rendering, Dispatcher/Timer for the game loop, and MAUI input events for input controls. No Unity, no Raylib, no SkiaSharp unless absolutely necessary (prefer pure MAUI Graphics).
